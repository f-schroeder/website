# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "<b>Line Space, BVH and Octree</b> <br>Together with Kevin Keul, Tilman Koß and Stefan Müller I worked on research and development of new GPU-based data structures to accelerate GPU-ray-tracing. This includes the development of the new Line Space data structure as well as research in bounding volume hierarchies, recursive grids and sparse voxel octrees (all of them on the GPU)."
