# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "<b>Construction of a gonioreflectometer to capture and render BRDFs</b> <br>The goal is to construct a gonioreflectometer using microcontrollers (Arduino) and stepper motors with code written in Java using OpenCV. With this device, BRDFs of arbitrary materials can be captured. This project also includes rendering the captured BRDFs using C++ and OpenGL. Furthermore I am going to experiment with light fields, light stages and 3D-scanning."
