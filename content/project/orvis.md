summary = "<b>Modern OpenGL 4.6 and C++17 rendering framework</b> <br>This is my most recent framework for personal projects and quick and easy development of OpenGL based applications. <br>It uses modern C++17, OpenGL 4.6 and a GPU-driven rendering pipeline including [AZDO](https://www.slideshare.net/CassEveritt/approaching-zero-driver-overhead), [DSA](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access), [bindless textures](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Bindless_Texture) and [indirect multi-draw](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Rendering#Indirect_rendering) calls. It also automatically performs GPU-view-frustum-culling and contains a fast model-loader, PBR-shading and various other real-time rendering techniques."
