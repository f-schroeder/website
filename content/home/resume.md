## Work experience

The main topic of my work is computer graphics. I am especially focused on developing new photorealistic and real-time rendering techniques.

As a student assistant I am supporting Prof. Dr. Müller and Kevin Keul at the University of Koblenz with their research on the Line Space data structure for fast and efficient GPU ray tracing. 
This also includes research in BVHs, two-level data structures, recursive grids and octrees.

Please also refer to my personal projects above and on [GitHub](https://github.com/f-schroeder).

If you prefer to get my full CV as PDF-document, just send me an e-mail.
