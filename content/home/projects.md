## OneHit
#### 3D multiplayer battle arena game (Unreal Engine 4.10)

In this multiplayer game players fight against each other in fast and action-packed battles. 
Each one has to choose one of the four characters and use a variety of attack and defense skills to defeat the opponents. 
The clou: just a single hit kills, so one has to be careful.

This game received the **third price of the CV-Award 2016** at the University of Koblenz.

OneHit was released on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/697270/OneHit/) on 10/31/2017.

## CVARK
#### AR-Framework

In this internship I developed the augmented reality framework "CVARK" at the University of Koblenz together with 13 other students.
We used NVIDIA PhysX, OpenCV and OpenGL as well as C++ and GLSL to implement a funny AR-Game.
Take a look at the [demo-video](https://www.facebook.com/followcvark/videos/593819184114932/) to get a better impression.
